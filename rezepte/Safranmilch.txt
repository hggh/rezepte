Safranmilch (saffron milk)
━━━━━━━━━━━

Ingredients for four cups
───────────

• 7–9 saffron threads
• 5–7 cardamom pods
• 4 cups milk of choice (traditionally, sheep milk,
  but other dairy and nōn-dairy (nut, rice, oat, coconut, …)
  options work wonderfully as well)
• a handful dried rose petals
• 1 cinnamon stick
• 1 teaspoon rose water (optional)
• sweetener of choice

Method
──────

In a mortar and pestle, ground the threads of saffron
into a fine powder. Put aside.

Next, grind the cardamom pods in a mortar and pestle
until the aroma is revealed; put aside.

In a small pot, add milk, ground cardamom, rose petals
and cinnamon, and bring the temperature up to just
before a boil. Once you have reached a gentle simmer,
stir in the saffron powder, rose water (if using) and
sweetener to taste. Let the milk simmer for another
two to four minutes, stirring occasionally, until the
colour turns golden.

Strain, serve, and enjoy while warm.
