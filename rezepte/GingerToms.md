Isle of Wight Ginger Toms
=========================

The Isle of Wight tells the story of Ginger Tom — a cat that is said to
slide in and out of people’s letter boxes through the night. If you meet
him and offer him a special type of gingerbread (named after him) he
will grant you his ear and give you advice.

But here’s the rub, if he does not like the treat he will not tell you,
but his advice will be bad. It is only he enjoys the ginger that he will
give you good advice.

If however, he visits and you have nothing to offer, then Ginger Tom
will leave, never to visit you again.

  roll out on a floured surface to ca. 1½ cm thick

- gingerbread should be soft; it is not meant to be as hard as a biscuit
- decorate in a way that represents your family
