Cook both egg noodles and homestyle meatballs as directed on package.
Brown the hamburger meat; do not drain the grease adding for flavour,
pour in hearty beef sauce as well as the whipping cream.

Stir together, adding 2 Tbsp garlic while stirring.

Once the egg noodles are done, drain and rinse.

Soon the meatballs finish; let them cool a few minutes, then add them
in with the hamburger, sauce, whipping cream and garlic. Add noodles,
stirring everything all together put on simmer for a little bit.
