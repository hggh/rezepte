Uncle Bubba’s Peanut Butter Soup
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INGREDIENTS
───────────

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium-size yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 or 2 hot or minced chillis, to your taste, seeded and chopped
  (I add more when it’s just me)
1 ½ teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
½ tablespoon light brown sugar
¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
1 ½ pounds winter squash, such as butternut or Buttercup, seeded,
  peeled, and cut into bite-size cubes (about 3 ½ cups)
1 ½ cups water
¼ cup creamy natural peanut butter
Salt and freshly-ground black pepper
1 ½ cups cooled black-eyed peas or one 15-ounce can, drained and rinsed
½ cup chopped unsalted roasted peanuts

METHOD
──────

1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion.
   Cover and cook, stirring a few times until softened — about five
   minutes. Stir in the garlic, chillis, ginger, brown sugar, cinnamon,
   and cumin and cook for 1 minute. Add the squash and stir to coat with
   the spices. Add 1 ¼ cup of the water and salt and pepper to taste.
   Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.

2. Put the peanut butter into a small bowl and slowly add the remaining
   ¼ cup water, stirring until smooth.

3. Stir the peanut butter mixture into the stew. Cover and simmer until
   the vegetables are tender — about 30 minutes. Allow 10 minutes before
   the end of the cooking time and add the black-eyed peas and peanuts.
   Simmer until heated through. Before serving, taste to adjust the
   seasonings.

Doubles and triples beautifully.
Serves 6 as a first course and 3 or 4 as a meal.

“There is cabbage salad, maize pudding, groundnut stew on top of steamed
 millet, sautéed okra, and banana chutney to help cool the spicy stew.”
